  "centrality closeness": "Closeness",
  "centrality closeness desc": "Closeness centrality can help find good ‘broadcasters’, but in a highly-connected network, you will often find all nodes have a similar score. What may be more useful is using Closeness to find influencers in a single cluster.",
  "centrality betweenness": "Betweenness",
  "centrality betweenness desc": "Betweenness is useful for analyzing communication dynamics, but should be used with care. A high betweenness count could indicate someone holds authority over disparate clusters in a network, or just that they are on the periphery of both clusters.",
  "centrality degree": "Degree",
  "centrality degree desc": "Degree centrality is the simplest measure of node connectivity. Sometimes it’s useful to look at in-degree (number of inbound links) and out-degree (number of outbound links) as distinct measures, for example when looking at transactional data or account activity.",
  "centrality edge betweenness": "Betweenness (links)",
  "centrality edge betweenness desc": "Betweenness is useful for analyzing communication dynamics, but should be used with care. A high betweenness count could indicate someone holds authority over disparate clusters in a network, or just that they are on the periphery of both clusters.",
  "centrality eigen": "Eigen",
  "centrality eigen desc": "Eigen Centrality measures a node’s influence. It starts by measuring each nodes ‘degree’ score – which is simply a count of the number of links that node has to other nodes in the network. However, EigenCentrality goes a step further than degree centrality. It goes beyond the first-degree connections to count how many links their connections have, and so on through the network.",
  "centrality indegree": "Indegree",
  "centrality indegree desc": "Indegree centrality, also known as prestige centrality, represents the total number of interactions or links that a node has received from other.",
  "centrality outdegree": "Outdegree",
  "centrality outdegree desc": "Outdegree centrality represents the total number of outbound interactions or links from an actor to other nodes in the network.",
  "centrality pagerank": "Pagerank",
  "centrality pagerank desc": "PageRank’s main difference from EigenCentrality is that it accounts for link direction. Each node in a network is assigned a score based on its number of incoming links (its ‘indegree’). These links are also weighted depending on the relative score of its originating node. The result is that nodes with many incoming links are influential, and nodes to which they are connected share some of that influence.",
